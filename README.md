### Hi there 👋

### Who is mkgeeky?
A guy from Denmark who loves to code ❤️🧑‍💻.

#### Main Projects
I have forked [autodl-trackers](https://github.com/mkgeeky/autodl-trackers) and [autodl-irssi](https://github.com/mkgeeky/autodl-irssi) (original by thebigmunch).<br />
My idea is to keep autodl-trackers up2date, as good as possible.<br />
Also get autodl-irssi to work with my repo. But I'm not a perl expert :confused:
